# TabFuseNet: Multi-Modal Fusion for Tabular Data Analysis

## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository provides an official implementation and resources for **TabFuseNet**, a novel multi-modal fusion framework designed for enhanced tabular data analysis. TabFuseNet addresses the limitations of traditional methods by effectively integrating numerical and categorical features through a specialized fusion mechanism, leading to improved performance in various tabular learning tasks.
